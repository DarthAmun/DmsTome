## Features

### Campaign Management
- Multiple campaigns, each with a banner image, description, and full set of content
- Dashboard overview with quick stats and navigation to all sections
- All data persists offline in IndexedDB — no account or server needed

### Lore & World-Building

Nine entity types per campaign, each with a dedicated section:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Notes | Freeform markdown documents |
| NPCs | Characters with typed attribute blocks |
| Locations | Places with optional map images, sub-maps, and logo/banner |
| Factions | Organizations and groups |
| Events | World/story events with an optional timeline view |
| Sessions | Session summaries and logs |
| Quests | Quest tracking with status |
| Rumors | Rumor seeds and hooks |
| Random Tables | Rollable tables for improvisation |

Every entity supports:
- Markdown editor with live preview
- Typed attribute fields (stat blocks, images, dice, tags, links, clocks, checklists, and more)
- Entity links via `{{entity: Name}}` inline syntax
- Version snapshots with a labeled timeline (e.g. "Before Ascension", "Session 12")

### Knowledge Graph
- Interactive node graph of all campaign entities (Vue Flow)
- Create and label directional or bi-directional connections between entities
- Customize edge style and color per connection
- Save and restore named graph layouts
- Player-facing read-only graph view in a separate tab

### World Map
- Load any image as a world map (stored as base64 or URL)
- Pin any entity — NPC, faction, location, note — to a point on the map
- Click pins for an inline preview panel; drill into sub-maps (world → city → dungeon)
- Location entities each carry their own map with their own pins

### VTT Encounters (PixiJS)
- Load a map image and configure grid size and offset
- Token library — drag templates onto the map, snap to grid
- Per-token: name, image, HP, AC, initiative, size, conditions, visibility, dead/alive, notes
- Tokens can be linked directly to creature records from the rules library
- Fog of War — paint and erase fog cells; hide all / reveal all shortcuts
- Wall tool — draw line walls with cover types (full, ¾, ½, ¼, door) for line-of-sight blocking
- Field-of-view compute per token (vision range in tiles)
- Round/turn tracker with a combat log
- Sound playlist association per encounter
- **Player View** — opens in a separate browser tab, syncs in real-time via BroadcastChannel

### DM Screen
- Freeform widget board — add, resize, and rearrange panels
- Zoom and density controls; layout saved per campaign
- Available widgets: Dice Roller, NPC Generator, Conditions Grid, Random Table, Quest, Session, Note, Faction, Location, Rumor, Scratchpad, Rules Lookup, Encounter Link, Search, System Entity, Timer

### Rules Library (Systems)
- Define custom game systems (e.g. D&D 5e, PF2e) with a visual schema builder
- Create entity types (Spell, Creature, Item, …) with any combination of field types
- Supported field types: text, number, markdown, image, tags, select, multi-select, toggle, rating, dice formula, damage formula, attack block, stat block, abilities, speed, spell slots, conditions, proficiency, scaling, action cost, entity link, trait picker, checklist, clock, tracker, currency
- Populate a record library per entity type (spells, creatures, items, etc.)
- Import and export system schemas as JSON

### Audio
- Sound library with track management
- Playlists — assign a playlist to an encounter for ambient audio during play
- Playback controls with loop and volume

### Cross-Cutting Features
- **Global Search** — search across all entities in all campaigns
- **Command Palette** — keyboard-driven quick navigation
- **Bookmarks** — pin frequently accessed entities to a ribbon
- **Dice Roller** — available everywhere in the app
- **Settings** — theme and app-level preferences
- **Import / Export** — JSZip-based backup and restore

## Data & Backups

All data lives in browser IndexedDB under the key `dmstome`.

The app includes an import/export modal (JSZip) for in-app backup and restore of campaigns, encounters, entities, and system records.

Manual export: DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → right-click → Export
